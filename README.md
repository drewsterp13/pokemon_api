#Pokémon API Program
In this program, there are a list of pokémon that have been collected! Now, we need to analyze the different 
pokémon, such as their abilities, fortunately, this program can help with that. It gets the json from the url:
```https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=50&offset=0```, after that, it goes thru the list and gets the pokédex 
number and searches for that on the url, and then it goes on an another url based on the pokédex number. After that, 
the program gathers data, and displays it.

I hope that you will enjoy this progam and hang out with pikachu :)
